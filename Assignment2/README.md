Obejectives: conduct data wrangling and visualize the data with key questions in mind.

# Part 1 Data Wrangling

## Step1 reading and merging the data sets

```r
library(data.table)
library(dplyr)
```

```
## 
## Attaching package: 'dplyr'
```

```
## The following objects are masked from 'package:data.table':
## 
##     between, first, last
```

```
## The following objects are masked from 'package:stats':
## 
##     filter, lag
```

```
## The following objects are masked from 'package:base':
## 
##     intersect, setdiff, setequal, union
```

```r
library(dtplyr)

chs_ind <- data.table::fread("chs_individual.csv")
chs_reg <- data.table::fread("chs_regional.csv")

chs <- merge(chs_ind, chs_reg, by="townname")
```
The number of observations in chs and chs_ind is the same (1200), so there is no repeat data.

## Step 2 creating new categorical varible "obesity_level and summarize"

```r
chs$obesity_level <- as.factor(ifelse(chs$bmi < 14, 'underweight',
                               ifelse(chs$bmi < 22, 'normal', 
                               ifelse(chs$bmi < 24, 'overweight','obese' ))))

summary <- chs[,.(
  minimum = min(bmi, na.rm=TRUE),
  maximum = max(bmi, na.rm=TRUE),
  total = length(bmi)), by=obesity_level]
```

```
## Warning in min(bmi, na.rm = TRUE): no non-missing arguments to min; returning
## Inf
```

```
## Warning in max(bmi, na.rm = TRUE): no non-missing arguments to max; returning
## -Inf
```

```r
summary
```

```
##    obesity_level  minimum  maximum total
## 1:        normal 14.00380 21.96387   886
## 2:    overweight 22.02353 23.99650    87
## 3:         obese 24.00647 41.26613   103
## 4:          <NA>      Inf     -Inf    89
## 5:   underweight 11.29640 13.98601    35
```

## Step 3 Create another categorical variable "smoke_gas_exposure"

```r
chs[, smoke_gas_exposure := fifelse(smoke == 0 & gasstove == 0, "Neither",
        fifelse(smoke == 0 & gasstove == 1, "gas_only",
               fifelse(smoke == 1 & gasstove == 0, "smoke_only",
                       fifelse(smoke == 1 & gasstove == 1, "both", NA_character_))))]
#summarizing 
chs[,.(total = length(smoke)), by=smoke_gas_exposure]
```

```
##    smoke_gas_exposure total
## 1:            Neither   214
## 2:               <NA>    60
## 3:         smoke_only    36
## 4:           gas_only   739
## 5:               both   151
```
There are four categories and some missing values. 

## Step 4 Create four summary tables showing the average (or proportion, if binary) and sd of “Forced expiratory volume in 1 second (ml)” and asthma indicator by town, sex, obesity level, and “smoke_gas_exposure.”

```r
chs[, .(
    fev_avg_townname      = mean(fev, na.rm=TRUE),
    fev_sd_townname       = sd(fev, na.rm=TRUE),
    asthma_avg_townname   = mean(asthma, na.rm=TRUE),
    asthma_sd_townname    = sd(asthma, na.rm=TRUE)),
    by = townname
    ] 
```

From those figures we can see that BMI has a relatively positive association with FEV in all of these towns.

## Step2 Stacked histograms of FEV by BMI category and FEV by smoke/gas exposure. Use different color schemes than the ggplot default.

```r
ggplot(data=chs) +
  geom_histogram(aes(x=fev, fill=obesity_level), binwidth = 100)+
  scale_fill_brewer(palette = "Spectral")
```

```

## $x
## [1] "FEV"
## 
## $title
## [1] "Stacked histograms of FEV by BMI"
## 
## attr(,"class")
## [1] "labels"
```

From this stacked histogram we can see that people who are underweight has a relatively low fev, and people who are overweight and obese has a relatively high fev. People with normal bmi has fev that concentrated on normal range. 


```r
ggplot(data=chs[-which(is.na(chs$smoke_gas_exposure)=="TRUE"),]) +
  geom_histogram(aes(x=fev, fill=smoke_gas_exposure), binwidth = 100)+

## Warning: Removed 87 rows containing non-finite values (stat_bin).
```

![](README_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-4-1.png)<!-- -->

This figure does not show different distributions among the categories. They all seem normally distributed. 

## Step3 Barchart of BMI by smoke/gas exposure.

```r
ggplot(data=chs[-which(is.na(chs$obesity_level)=="TRUE"),]) +
  geom_bar(aes(x=obesity_level, fill=smoke_gas_exposure))+
  scale_fill_brewer(palette = "Spectral")+
  labs(title = "Barchart of BMI by smoke/gas exposure", x="BMI")
```

![](README_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-5-1.png)<!-- -->

This plot shows that the distribution of smoke/gas exposure is not different among the BMI categories. 

## Step4 Statistical summary graphs of FEV by BMI and FEV by smoke/gas exposure category.

```r
ggplot(data=chs[-which(is.na(chs$obesity_level)=="TRUE"),],mapping = aes(x = obesity_level, y = fev))+
  geom_boxplot()+
  labs(title = "statistical summary graph of FEV by BMI")
```

This figure gives similar information as the stacked histogram that people who are underweight has a relatively low fev, and people who are overweight and obese has a relatively high fev. People with normal bmi has fev that concentrated on normal range. 


```r
ggplot(data=chs[-which(is.na(chs$smoke_gas_exposure)=="TRUE"),],mapping = aes(x = smoke_gas_exposure, y = fev))+
  geom_boxplot()+
  labs(title = "statistical summary graph of FEV by smoke/gas exposure category")
```

This figure does not show different distributions among the categories.

## Step5 A leaflet map showing the concentrations of PM2.5 mass in each of the CHS communities.

```
The mass of PM2.5 is concentrated around Riverside and San Bernardino region, and spread out to the sides. 

## Step6 Choose a visualization to examine whether PM2.5 mass is associated with FEV.

```r
ggplot(data=chs, mapping=aes(x=pm25_mass, y=fev))+
  geom_point()+
  geom_smooth(method='lm', formula = y~x)
```

```
## Warning: Removed 95 rows containing non-finite values (stat_smooth).
```

```
## Warning: Removed 95 rows containing missing values (geom_point).
```

We can see from the figure that PM2.5 mass does not have obvious association with FEV.
